                     AUTHENTICATION & LOGIN GUIDE
================================================================================


IMPORTANT: THIS IS A PUBLIC GUEST PORTAL!
===========================================

This Supplier Portal does NOT require a login or account creation.

✅ You are automatically logged in as a guest user
✅ No username/password needed
✅ No account creation required
✅ No registration form
✅ Just open and start using it!


HOW TO ACCESS THE DASHBOARD:
=============================


1. FROM YOUR COMPUTER (Local Development)
   =====================================
   
   Start the Flask server:
   $ python app.py
   
   Then open your browser:
   http://localhost:3000
   
   OR go directly to:
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard_with_api.html
   
   That's it! You're automatically logged in as guest.
   

2. FROM RENDER (Live on Internet)
   ==============================
   
   Once deployed to Render, just visit:
   https://supplier-portal-2kau.onrender.com
   
   Automatically logged in! No login screen!
   

3. LOCAL FILE (Offline Mode)
   =========================
   
   Double-click the HTML file:
   dashboard_with_api.html
   
   Note: This works but doesn't load suppliers.json unless you run Flask server.
   

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU OPEN THE DASHBOARD:
===========================================

1. Browser opens the page
2. JavaScript detects no user is logged in
3. System automatically creates a guest user:
   - Email: guest@supplier-portal.local
   - Name: Guest User
   - Role: Viewer
   - Saved to browser localStorage
4. Dashboard loads
5. Calls /api/suppliers endpoint
6. Flask server returns 500 suppliers from suppliers.json
7. Dashboard displays all suppliers
8. You can search, filter, favorite, and add notes
9. All your data is saved in browser localStorage


YOUR DATA (Favorites & Notes):
==============================

✅ WHERE DATA IS STORED:
   Browser's localStorage on your computer
   Not on any server
   
✅ WHAT'S STORED:
   - Your favorites (list of supplier IDs you liked)
   - Your notes (text notes for each supplier)
   - Your preferences (theme, filters, etc.)
   
✅ HOW LONG IT'S STORED:
   Indefinitely, until you clear browser data
   
✅ ACCESSING YOUR DATA:
   On the same computer, same browser
   Other computers won't see your favorites/notes
   
✅ CLEARING YOUR DATA:
   Browser Settings → Clear browsing data → localStorage
   

USER DROPDOWN MENU:
====================

Click the "👤 Guest" button in the top right to see:

  - Inbox (messages/notifications)
  - My Favorites (suppliers you bookmarked)
  - My Notes (notes about suppliers)
  - Logout (return to guest login)

Note: Logout just resets you and reloads the page as guest again.


FEATURES AVAILABLE:
====================

All features work for guest users:

✅ Search suppliers by name, location, category
✅ Filter by state, region, category, rating
✅ View supplier details and contact info
✅ Add suppliers to favorites (saved locally)
✅ Add notes about suppliers (saved locally)
✅ Compare multiple suppliers
✅ View ratings and reviews
✅ See products and certifications
✅ Check stock levels and lead times
✅ Sort and paginate results


NO GUEST LIMITATIONS:
======================

Unlike some systems, there are NO limitations for guest users:

✅ Same access as registered users
✅ Can favorite unlimited suppliers
✅ Can add unlimited notes
✅ Can search and filter everything
✅ Can compare suppliers
✅ Full feature access

This is a PUBLIC portal - everyone gets full access!


DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION:
==========================

The app.py has this configuration:

    # Enable CORS for ALL routes
    CORS(app)
    
    # No authentication required
    # No login endpoints
    # No authorization middleware
    # Just public API access

Meaning:
- Anyone can access the /api/suppliers endpoint
- No API key required
- No token authentication
- No rate limiting
- Pure public data


IF YOU FORGET YOU'RE LOGGED IN:
=================================

Don't worry! The system handles it:

1. Page loads
2. JavaScript checks localStorage for 'currentUser'
3. If not found, creates guest user
4. Saves to localStorage
5. Page loads normally

So if you:
- Close and reopen browser ✅ Still logged in as guest
- Clear browser history ❌ You lose guest status (but just reload)
- Use different browser ❌ Different guest data
- Use incognito/private mode ❌ Data lost after closing
