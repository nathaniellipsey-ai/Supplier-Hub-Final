  RENDER NOT AUTO-DEPLOYING - HERE'S THE FIX
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
  - Files are on GitHub
  - You committed them
  - But Render doesn't deploy anything

REASON:
  Render isn't connected to watch your GitHub repo for changes
  OR you need to manually trigger a deploy

================================================================================
  SOLUTION #1: MANUAL DEPLOY (FASTEST - 2 MINUTES)
================================================================================

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com

2. Find your service (walmart-supplier-portal or similar)

3. Look for a button like:
   - "Manual Deploy"
   - "Deploy Latest"
   - "Redeploy"
   - "Deploy"

4. Click it

5. Watch the status:
   Yellow "Building" - 2-3 minutes
   Green "Live" - Done!

6. Check the logs:
   - Should show: "npm install"
   - Should show: "Server running on port"
   - Should show: "All endpoints integrated"

7. Test your app:
   - Click the URL
   - Dashboard should load
   - SUCCESS!

================================================================================
  SOLUTION #2: ENABLE AUTO-DEPLOY (PERMANENT FIX)
================================================================================

If you want Render to auto-deploy on every GitHub push:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com

2. Click your service

3. Go to: Settings tab (usually on the right)

4. Look for: "Git Connection" or "GitHub Connection"

5. Make sure it shows:
   - Repository: supplier-portal (or your repo name)
   - Branch: main
   - Auto-Deploy: ENABLED (turn ON if it's OFF)

6. Save settings

7. Now future pushes will auto-deploy!

================================================================================
  SOLUTION #3: RECONNECT GITHUB (IF NEEDED)
================================================================================

If GitHub isn't connected:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com

2. Click your service

3. Go to: Settings

4. Look for: "Git Connection"

5. If it says "Not connected" or similar:
   - Click "Connect Repository"
   - Select your GitHub account
   - Select: supplier-portal
   - Click "Connect"

6. Set:
