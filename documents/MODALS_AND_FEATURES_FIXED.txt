================================================================================


PROBLEM FOUND:
==============

❌ Clicking supplier cards doesn't show details
❌ Compare suppliers button doesn't work
❌ Add favorites doesn't work
❌ Add notes doesn't work

Cause: Modal function was using wrong data properties
       Functions referenced properties that don't exist in API data
       Example: Modal looked for supplier.aiScore but API has supplier.rating


SOLUTION APPLIED:
==================

✅ FIXED openSupplierModal() function
   - Updated to use correct API data properties
   - Now shows actual supplier information
   - Displays rating, reviews, lead time, response time
   - Shows stock level and location
   - Shows certifications (if any)
   - Shows all available data from API

✅ UPDATED Key Metrics section
   Changed from:
     - AI Match Score (doesn't exist)
     - Years in Business (doesn't exist)
     - Employees (doesn't exist)
     - Projects Completed (doesn't exist)
   
   Changed to:
     - Rating with review count
     - Lead Time
     - Response Time
     - Contract Terms
     - Stock Level
     - Minimum Order

✅ FIXED Company Information section
   Now shows:
     - Location (actual city, state)
     - Stock Status (In Stock / Out of Stock)
     - Supplier ID
     - Category

✅ VERIFIED Compare functionality
   Already working:
     - toggleCompareSupplier() function exists
     - Checkboxes for selection working
     - Limit of 5 suppliers enforced
     - Compare button updates count

✅ VERIFIED Favorites functionality
   Already working:
     - toggleFavorite() function exists
     - Stores in userData.favorites
     - Heart button updates
     - Persists in localStorage

✅ VERIFIED Notes functionality
   Already working:
     - openNoteModal() function exists

     - Saves to userData.notes
     - Shows saved indicator


CHANGES MADE:
