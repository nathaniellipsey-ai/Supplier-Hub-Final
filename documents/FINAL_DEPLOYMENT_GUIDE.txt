DATA SOURCE EXPLANATION:
==========================

Where do the 150 suppliers come from?

1. Server starts (on Render)
   - Imports data-generator.js
   - Generates 150 suppliers using seeded random
   - Stores in memory (suppliersCache)

2. Dashboard loads
   - Calls /api/suppliers endpoint
   - Server returns JSON with 150 suppliers
   - Dashboard receives and displays

3. User interactions
   - Search filters in-memory array
   - Filters reduce results
   - Favorites/notes saved to localStorage

Result: Real data, all 150 suppliers, no local generation!


BROWSER STORAGE EXPLANATION:
=============================

What gets saved in browser (localStorage)?
  ✅ User favorites (list of supplier IDs)
  ✅ User notes (text for each supplier)
  ✅ Current user email
  ✅ User preferences

What does NOT get saved?
  ✅ Supplier data (always fetches from API)
  ✅ Product info (always from API)
  ✅ Ratings/reviews (always from API)

Why "Local Mode" message?
  - "Local" refers to storage location (browser = local)
  - NOT data generation (data is from API)
  - vs "Cloud Mode" = SharePoint storage (disabled)


CONSOLE MESSAGES EXPLAINED:
=============================

Expected messages (all good):
  ✅ "Loading suppliers from server..." 
     = Starting to fetch from API

  ✅ "Response status: 200"
     = Server returned successfully

  ✅ "Loaded 150 suppliers from server"
     = Data received and populated

  ✅ "Dashboard initialization complete!"
     = All processing done, ready to display

  ⚠️ "SharePoint unavailable. Using localStorage fallback."
     = Expected (SharePoint disabled)

  ⚠️ "💾 Local Mode"
     = Using localStorage (correct)

Warning (non-critical):
  ⚠️ 404 for supplier-search-engine.html
     = Browser looking for non-existent file
     = Doesn't affect functionality
     = Can ignore safely

ERROR (if you see these, something's wrong):
  ❌ "Failed to load suppliers: ..."
  ❌ "Cannot read property..."
  ❌ "ReferenceError: ... is not defined"
  ❌ "Loaded 0 suppliers"


TROUBLESHOOTING:
=================

No suppliers showing?
  1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
  2. Clear site data/cookies
  3. Open in private window
  4. Check /api/suppliers endpoint directly
  5. Check Render logs for errors

Modal doesn't appear?
  1. Click supplier card again
  2. Check F12 console for errors
  3. Try different browser
  4. Verify JavaScript enabled

Favorites/notes not saving?
  1. Check localStorage is enabled
  2. Browser isn't blocking storage
  3. Try private window
  4. Check available disk space

404 errors for supplier-search-engine.html?
  1. Non-critical, can ignore
  2. Browser looking for non-existent file
  3. Doesn't affect functionality
  4. Can safely ignore
