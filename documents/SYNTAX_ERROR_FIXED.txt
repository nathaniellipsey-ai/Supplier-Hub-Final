================================================================================
        ✅ SYNTAX ERROR FIXED!
================================================================================


ERROR FOUND:
=============

Console error:
  "Missing catch or finally after try"
  SyntaxError in dashboard_with_api.html

Location:
  openNoteModal() function
  Around line 3694

Cause:
  Indentation issue causing parser confusion
  const modalHTML = `` ` was not properly indented
  Made the try/catch block look malformed


FIX APPLIED:
==============

Corrected indentation in openNoteModal():

BEFORE (WRONG):
  try {
    const currentNote = ...;

  const modalHTML = `  // ← WRONG INDENTATION!
    ...
  `;
  } catch (error) {

AFTER (CORRECT):
  try {
    const currentNote = ...;

    const modalHTML = `  // ← CORRECT INDENTATION
      ...
    `;
  } catch (error) {

File: dashboard_with_api.html
Lines: 3693-3709
Status: ✅ FIXED


DEPLOYMENT:
============

TO APPLY THE FIX:

1. Download dashboard_with_api.html from your project
   (The file has been updated locally)

2. Copy the fixed version to GitHub:
   git add dashboard_with_api.html
   git commit -m "Fix: Correct indentation in openNoteModal function"
   git push origin main

3. Go to Render dashboard
   https://render.com/dashboard

4. Click supplier-portal service

5. Click "Manual Deploy" to trigger rebuild

6. Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment

7. Open dashboard when "Live" status shows
   https://supplier-portal-2kau.onrender.com

8. Should now show:
   ✅ Dashboard loaded (not showing "connecting")
   ✅ 150 suppliers visible
   ✅ No syntax errors in console
   ✅ All features working


WHAT WAS WRONG:
================

The indentation issue caused the try/catch to look malformed.
Parser couldn't find the matching catch for the try block.

File: dashboard_with_api.html
